      of data that will be auto-linked.</b>  In
      this text are some things that are actionable.  For instance,
      you can click on http://www.google.com and it will launch the
      web browser.  You can click on google.com too.  If you
      click on (415) 555-1212 it should dial the phone.  Or just write
      foobar@example.com for an e-mail link.  If you have a URI like
      http://www.example.com/lala/foobar@example.com you should get the
      full link not the e-mail address.  Or you can put a location
      like 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043.  To summarize:
      https://www.google.com, or 650-253-0000, somebody@example.com,
      or 9606 North MoPac Expressway, Suite 400, Austin, TX 78759.</string>
